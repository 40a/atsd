# Getting Started: Part 5

### SQL

OpenÂ [SQL] tab in the top menu.

Enter the following query:

```sql
SELECT entity, metric, datetime, value
  FROM 'my-metric'
WHERE entity = 'my-entity'
  AND datetime >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z'
ORDER BY datetime
```

Modify the query to add aggregation and groupings:

```sql
SELECT entity, datetime, MAX(value), COUNT(value)
  FROM 'my-metric'
WHERE entity = 'my-entity'
  AND datetime >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z'
GROUP BY entity, PERIOD(1 HOUR)
  ORDER BY datetime
```

Review the [SQL syntax](../api/sql/README.md) and experiment by executing your own queries.
