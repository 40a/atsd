# Python


Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language. Its syntax allows programmers to use fewer lines of code to
than other languages like java to express the same concept.

Axibase has created an API Client for Python that enables developers to
easily read and write statistics and metadata from ATSD.

GitHub.](https://github.com/axibase/atsd-api-python)

ATSD client is also hosted on pypi:
