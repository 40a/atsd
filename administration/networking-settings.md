If youâ€™re anticipating high data insertion rate with bursts of 100000
packets per second or more, increase maximum receiving buffer on Linux
OS as follows and restart ATSD:

```sh
 sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=8388608                                 
```

This setting would allow the operating system and ATSD to buffer up to 8
megabytes of received packets in case the inserting rate is temporarily
higher than ATSD throughput rate.

The increased buffer would also reduce or even eliminate the number of
UDP datagrams dropped due to buffer overflow.
