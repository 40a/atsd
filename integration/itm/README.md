# IBM Tivoli Monitoring

## Overview

In order to offload detailed data from ITM infrastructure with minimal latency you need to enable ITM Warehouse Proxy Agent to dump incoming analytical data into CSV files on the local file system. The dump directory will be continously monitored by an `inotify` script which will upload new CSV files into ATSD as soon as they are created.

This enables ATSD to serve as a long-term repository of historical data that is typically deleted after a few months by ITM in order to minimize the disk space usage in Tivoli Data Warehouse.

Since statistics from ITM agents will be received by ATSD without any delay, the integration can be used for real-time analytics and peformance dashboards.

## Installation steps

## Configure ITM Warehouse Proxy Agent

* Configure WPA to store analytical data received from agents into CSV files on the local file system as described [here](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSATHD_7.7.0/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2/adminuse/history_analytics_scenarios.htm "WPA")

* Set `hd.ini` settings to enable private history streaming:

    * Go to ITM folder and append the following strings to your `config/hd.ini` file:

        ```ini
        KHD_CSV_OUTPUT_ACTIVATE=Y
        KHD_CSV_OUTPUT=/tmp/itm/csv
        KHD_CSV_OUTPUT_TAGGED_ONLY=Y
        KHD_CSV_ISO_DATE_FORMAT=Y
        KHD_CSV_MAXSIZE=400
        KHD_CSV_EVAL_INTERVAL=60
        ```
    * Then restart WareHouse Proxy agent:

        ```sh
        bin/itmcmd stop hd
        bin/itmcmd start hd
        ```

## Configure ITM Agents

* Copy situation config to localconfig/${PRODUCT_CODE}/

    `${PRODUCT_CODE}` is an agent id. You can find  ids of most popular products [here](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21265222).

    > The configs has a specific name ${PRODUCT_CODE}_situations.xml.

* You can download configs of the following products:
    - [Linux OS](csv-configs/agents/lz_situations.xml)
    - [VMware](csv-configs/agents/vm_situations.xml)
    - [IBM MQ](csv-configs/agents/mq_situations.xml)

* After copying you need restart agent
    ```sh
    bin/itmcmd stop ${PRODUCT_CODE}
    bin/itmcmd start ${PRODUCT_CODE}
    ```

## Upload CSV Parsers into ATSD

- Import CSV parser definitions into ATSD for particular agent codes: UX, PA, LZ, NT, VM, T3, UD, etc.
  - Login to ATSD UI.
  - Go to `Configuration->CSV:Parsers` page.
  - Click 'Import' button.
  - Select one of the following parsers depending on your product:
      - [Linux OS](csv-configs/atsd/klz-csv-configs.xml)
      - [VMware](csv-configs/atsd/kvm-csv-configs.xml)
      - [IBM MQ](csv-configs/atsd/mq-csv-configs.xml)

## Configure `inotify` script to read CSV files and upload them into ATSD

* Download [inotify_sender](inotify_sender.sh) script on your ITM host.

* Set your ATSD host by editing following string in script:
    ```sh
    if [ "$url" = "" ]; then
        url="http://atsd_host:8088"
    fi
    ```

* Set permissions to execute script:
    ```sh
    chmod a+x inotify_sender.sh
    ```

* Run the script with the following command:
    ```sh
    ./inotify_sender.sh
    ```
* Check script logs in `/tmp/itm/logs` directory.

* Add script to autostart

## Verifying Data in ATSD

* Login into ATSD
* Click on Metrics tab and filter metrics by following prefixes:

 - `klz`
