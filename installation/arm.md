# Installation on ARM Devices

This installation requires Ubuntu OS or Debian OS installed on Raspberry
Pi 2 or another ARM based device.

Be sure that the target deviceÂ has at least 1 GB of RAM and 16GB hard
drive or SD card (we recommend using SD cards with high write speeds, at
least 60mb/s), depending on the device.
